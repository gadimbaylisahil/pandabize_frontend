### Prerequisites

npm

## Installation

Clone the repository and cd to the dir.

```
 npm install
 npm start
```

On development application will send requests to localhost:8081/, 
so it would be better to run your Rails Server at that port.

## Running Tests

```
npm test
```

If you have issue in running tests try running 
`brew install watchman`
